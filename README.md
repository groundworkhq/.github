Groundwork is an open-source project that provides a set of foundational Terraform modules and custom components to help startups quickly and securely set up their Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure. By leveraging best practices and pre-configured settings, Groundwork enables teams to focus on building their products without worrying about the complexities of cloud infrastructure.
